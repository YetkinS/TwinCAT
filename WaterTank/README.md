# Water-tank system (Level Control)

In this sample project, a non-linear model of a water-tank system is controller with a discrete PI controller in real-time. The non-linear plant was linearized in Matlab, and initial controller gains were obtained. The non-linear plant model was built using C++ coder and it was exported to the TwinCAT runtime environment. In addition, autotune function adapted to the system so that the controller can be tuned while system operates.
